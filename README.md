# Indy's Layer FIxer
A Tiled 1.8+ extension to automatically fix layers and vertical offsets on ONB maps!
<br>

## What does it do?

Have you ever realized you need to add a lower floor on your ONB map and didn't want to go through the hassle of fixing all the layer names and vertical offsets? Yep, me too. It's a pain. This plugin fixes that. All you need to do is (1) add your extra Tile and Object layers to your map, (2) position them correctly in the Layers menu on the right, and (3) run "Fix Layers for ONB" (under the Edit menu) and the layers will all be renamed and the offsets fixed per the order in the Layers menu.

## How do I install this?

1. Make sure you have Tiled 1.8 **or newer**.
2. Open Tiled and go to Settings... ( _Ctrl + ,_ )
3. Go to the Plugins tab and click "Open..." near the bottom.
4. Copy `indys-layer-fixer.js` into the folder that opens.

Under the Edit menu you will see a new option at the bottom named "Fix Layers for ONB". You can also use Ctrl+P to run the command.
